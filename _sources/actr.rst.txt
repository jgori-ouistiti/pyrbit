ACT-R
=======================


The ACT-R model
---------------------------------

We use one of the ACT-R model described in [1]_. The model reads

.. math::

    m & = \log \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta t_i^{-d} \right)                                \\
    p & = \left( 1 + \exp\left(\frac{\tau -m }{s}\right) \right)^{-1}


where the activation, :math:`m` , is a power function of the times :math:`\Delta t_i` since the item :math:`i` was presented, and the exponent :math:`d` stands for delay, and :math:`s` and :math:`\tau` are parameters that add extra flexibility to the model.
In comparison with the EF model where recall is just a function of when the last item was presented, the ACT-R model accounts for all past item presentations via :math:`m`.
